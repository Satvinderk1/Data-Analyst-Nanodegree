# Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results

## Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It
is important to get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

This project is designed to get the understanding of the results of an A/B test
run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order
to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users
who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to help the company
understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps
run the experiment longer to make their decision.
