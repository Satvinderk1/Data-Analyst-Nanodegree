# Project 2: Investigate a Dataset

Medical Appointment No Shows Data Analysis.

## Overview:

In this project, I have analyzed no show medical appointments data in Brazil and
communicated my findings about it. This dataset contains information about 100k
medical appointments. Main focus of this project will be to find how different
characteristics related to patient or appointment affects the rate of no show.

## Install:

I have used following python libraries:

- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Goals:

- Go through all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Learn to propose questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then
find answers to those questions using exploratory data analysis
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format
you can use
- Communicate the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data
analysis code
- Get familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access
your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
