# Project 1: Explore Weather Trends

## Introduction

In this project, I have analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the local temperature trends to overall global temperature trends.

I have created a visualization and prepared a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and Boston, Massachusetts.

## Steps followed:

### 1. Extract the data
Extract required data from city_list and global_data tables in the given database and store it in city_data.csv.
I have provided the data from city_list and global_data tables in csv files in .gitignore folder.

### 2. Open up the CSV
I have used Microsoft Excel for opening my csv files and analyzing given data.

### 3. Create a line chart
I have created a line chart that compares Boston’s temperatures with the global temperatures using moving average in MS Excel.

### 4. Make observations
I have documented my observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Boston’s averages, as well as overall trends.
